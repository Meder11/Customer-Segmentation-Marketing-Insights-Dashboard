# Customer-Segmentation-Marketing-Insights-Dashboard

âœ… Situation
A retail company wanted to better understand customer behavior and spending patterns in order to improve marketing strategies and optimize channel investments.

ðŸ“‹ Task
As a data analyst, my goal was to clean and analyze customer purchase data, segment the customer base using clustering, and visualize the results in a clear and actionable Power BI dashboard.

ðŸ”§ Action
Cleaned and enriched the dataset using Pandas in Python
Created new features like Age, Tenure, and TotalSpend
Handled datetime formatting and grouped variables for analysis
Applied KMeans clustering via Scikit-learn to segment customers into 3 groups
Exported the clustered dataset to Power BI
Built an interactive dashboard including:
KPI cards (Total Customers, Avg Spend, Avg Income)
Donut chart: Spend by Marital Status
Clustered bar chart: Channel usage by Segment
Time series: Total Spend Over Time
Filters for Education and Segment
ðŸ“ˆ Result
Identified three distinct customer segments:
Low-income, low-engagement
High-income, high-spending loyalists
Moderate-income, deal-seeking web buyers
Delivered actionable insights for marketing teams to target high-value segments and tailor campaigns to behavioral patterns.
